## Description 

This project was fun. I ran into a few problems.

I used Bootstrap for mostly everything.
I added a Navbar and also fixed the navbar so that the clicks will work and i also floted the nav links to the right..
I was having problems adding my picture. <img src="./Assets/Images/ScreenShot1.png">
It will show up on my computer but not the web.
