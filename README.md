## Description 

This project was fun. I ran into a few problems.

I used Bootstrap for mostly everything.
I added a Navbar and also fixed the navbar so that the clicks will work and i also floated the nav links to the right..
I was having problems adding my picture. <img src="./Assets/Images/ScreenShot1.png">
It will show up on my computer but not the web.
Here I used semantic HTML.  <img src="./Assets/Images/ScreenShot3.png">
On my contacts.... It was not hard at all... but i still have to take my time.  <img src="./Assets/Images/ScreenShot4.png">
All and All, Over all. This homework made me stronger... i know i didnt finish but i am still going to work on it through out this program.
