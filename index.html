I have been on a long road to finding myself. I had to let alot of people go because they did not want anything, but i wanted everything. I have never gave up on anything no matter how bad it get, i still seem to want to do more. Its so easy to give up, and i never want anything easy. This project was hard but i still put my all into it... i stay up long nights trying to do it on my own. I have made alot of mistake. But i am still pushing forwards.</p>
