                    A Little About Me. Well i have been a creator forever.
                    Music, anima, and now i want to make a living making
                    websites. I have always looked at coding. I always wanted to
                    know how it works. I started of learning python and it was
                    really hard. That is what made me love it so much. The fact
                    that i can do a little. I really want to find out where I
                    end up and how far I go.

                    I have a son with autism. Its alot but I know god would
                    never but too much on me i can not handle. Like This
                    project. I have been on a long road to finding myself. I had
                    to let alot of people go because they did not want anything,
                    but i wanted everything. I have never gave up on anything no
                    matter how bad it get, i still seem to want to do more. Its
                    so easy to give up, and i never want anything easy. This
                    project was hard but i still put my all into it... i stay up
                    long nights trying to do it on my own. I have made alot of
                    mistake. But i am still pushing forwards.
